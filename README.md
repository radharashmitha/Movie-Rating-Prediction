# Movie-Rating-Prediction
## Project Overview
This project predicts **IMDb movie ratings** based on attributes like **duration, genre, director, and actors**.  
We use **machine learning models** to analyze Indian movies and provide **accurate rating predictions**.

## Features
âœ” Data Preprocessing (Handling Missing Values, Encoding Categorical Data)  
âœ” Feature Engineering (Director Success Rate, Genre Popularity, etc.)  
âœ” Model Training (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)  
âœ” Model Evaluation (RÂ² Score, MAE, RMSE)  
âœ” Selection of the **Best Performing Model**

## Steps to Run the Project  
### **Open & Run the Google Colab Notebook**
1. Open **[Movie Rating Prediction.ipynb]** in **Google Colab**.
2. Upload the dataset **`IMDb Movies India.csv`** if prompted.
3. Run all cells **sequentially** to:
   - **Preprocess the data** (handle missing values, encode categorical features).
   - **Train machine learning models** (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).
   - **Evaluate model performance** and **predict IMDb movie ratings**.
